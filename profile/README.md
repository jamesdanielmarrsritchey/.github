# Introduction

Creator from Canada. Developing whatever sparks my interest.

# Project Prefixes

Most of my projects following a naming scheme, which involves adding a special prefix. The prefixes are mostly for my benefit, but if you're interested, they're explained below.

## Ritchey (ritchey)

Projects using this prefix are solo projects. Contributions are generally not accepted.

## Ritchey & AI (ritcheyandai)

Projects using this prefix are typically projects I've developed largely using AI tools. **For the most part, they are meant as custom examples**, rather than finished polished works, which may aid me when developing other projects.

**Note:** just because a project does not use this prefix, does not mean it hasn't involved AI use, at some stage.

## Ritchey & Contributors (ritcheyandcontributors)

Projects using this prefix are like solo projects, except they are open to contributions from other people.

## Others & Ritchey (othersandritchey)

Projects using this prefix are either projects that I've forked from other people's projects, or they are group projects I'm part of.
